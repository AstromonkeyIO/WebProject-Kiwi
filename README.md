kiwi - personal web application project

Kiwi is my personal web application project that allows college students to vote, comment, and share which food they liked
at their cafeterias and help the chefs understand which type of delicacies that majority of students enjoy, thus improving
dinning experience of the college students. User can tag foods and see what dishes their friends liked or disliked and 
add or delete friends, and communicate with other users. This project is my first web-application that introduced me to web technologies and helped me gain understanding of some essential elements of social network. 
Since this was my recreational project and my first coding experience in the web, some of the files are very messy and have ugly coding structures that still need to be corrected. 

. There is still little bit of work to be done to reach its completion. 

Languages used - PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
